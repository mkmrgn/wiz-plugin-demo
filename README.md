## Wiz Plugin Demo

This repo contains a demo [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/home) pipeline that makes use of the [Wiz Buildkite Plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/wiz-buildkite-plugin) to perform a Container Image Scan using the plugin.

There are other options available, so be sure to check out the repo's README for more options if you're keen on using this.
